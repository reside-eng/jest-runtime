**NOTE** This package was intentionally left as JS instead of being converted to TS because it is only a slight modification of existing Jest code

1. Install SWC if you haven't already `@swc/core @swc/jest`
1. Make sure to configure SWC if you haven't already:

   ```
   {
      "jsc": {
         "parser": {
            "syntax": "typescript",
            "decorators": true
         },
         "transform": {
            "legacyDecorator": true,
            "decoratorMetadata": true
         }
      }
   }
   ```

1. Install custom runtime: `yarn add @side/jest-runtime`
1. Use within `jest.config.js`:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     transform: {
       '^.+\\.ts$': '@swc/jest',
     },
     runtime: '@side/jest-runtime',
   };
   ```

This is the template repository for creating additional typescript libraries.
Once a new repository has been created off this template, follow the steps below
to finalize the initial setup process:

1. Find all relevant `TODO:` references and make adjustments accordingly
1. Start making PRs with basic functionality - continue to next section once library is publishable

## Enable Publishing

1. Add your new repository to the repositories with access to [`NPM_PUBLISH_TOKEN` org level secret](https://github.com/organizations/reside-eng/settings/secrets/actions/NPM_PUBLISH_TOKEN)
1. Create a PR removing `if: ${{ false }}` from release workflow
1. Merge above mentioned PR to create first release - this will take a while since all PRs up until this first release will be marked as released by semantic-release
